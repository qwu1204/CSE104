<br>
<hr>
<p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I discovered my interest for computer science in my computational oriented research, and therefore plan to apply for a Computer Science Master after graduation. 
</p>
 <br>
 <p>My research interests include biomedical image processing and computer graphics. I have worked on two imaging processing software so far. The first one is for hyperspectral imaging of biological specimens. The goal is to analyze the pattern hidden underneath surface through optical properties, and it is able to tell the difference in water content between two leaves that have left the branch for 12h and 24h, respectively.
 The second project is for cardiac optical mapping, which quantify the heterogeneity through a systematic, object manner. The program provides 3 different methods and run a machine learning algorithm to determine the final heterogeneity level of the cardiac data. It is proven to provide 90% accuracy with manually determined levels.</p>
